# Some Randoms Tools

## Why this tap?

Homebrew is a very cool package manager. But occasionally I found some packages are simply not what I need. E.g. missing service scripts, tool old versions. This tap holds better versions of those packages until those are fixed in the core tap.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install chuckchen/tools/<formula>`

Or `brew tap chuckchen/tools` and then `brew install <formula>`.
